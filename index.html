<h1>Hannah Rae Kerner</h1>

<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration in Exploration Systems Design: Systems Engineering and Robotics. My advisor is Dr. Jim Bell.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, B.S. Computer Science 2014 <br>
Cum laude with thesis "Autonomous Navigation for Micro-Air Vehicles using Reciprocal Velocity Objects". Advisor: Dr. Dinesh Manocha, Geometric Algorithms for Modeling, Motion, and Animation (GAMMA) research group

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>I am broadly interested in applying machine learning to robotic planning and control systems, in order to (1) improve the capability and scientific value of small, inexpensive spacecraft built with commodity hardware; (2) improve the throughput, workflow, and scientific return of existing spacecraft missions.</p>

<p>I work on the following missions:</p>
<ul>

	<li><strong>Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map)</strong>: This 6U CubeSat mission was recently selected by NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate to fly as a secondary payload on first Exploration Mission (EM-1) of the Space Launch System (SLS), scheduled to launch in July 2018. The mission is led by Arizona State University (PI: Dr. Craig Hardgrove) and I'm the lead systems and software engineer. LunaH-Map is being designed to fly a pair of neutron spectrometers to determine hydrogen abundances at the South Pole of the Moon at scales below 10 km in order to understand the relationship between volatiles and permanently shadowed regions.</li>

	<li><strong>Mars Science Laboratory (aka Curiosity)</strong>: I work on tactical software tools, e.g. compression artifact detection, for Mastcam.</li>

</ul>

<h2>"industry" interests</h2>

<p>Advancing the state of the art in space exploration toward permanent off-Earth human settlements through collaboration between space, tech, and private investment.</p>
